Arduino Fire Safety System

Objective: The Arduino Fire Safety System is a life-saving project designed to detect smoke in 
buildings and improve the chances of survival during a fire. When the smoke sensor detects smoke 
in the air, the system triggers an alarm, opens an exhaust flap, and activates a fan to expel smoke, 
allowing fresh air to enter the staircase area.

Components:

Smoke Detector: This sensor is the heart of the system, responsible for detecting the presence of smoke or fire in the vicinity.

Arduino Microcontroller: Manages the system's operations, including monitoring the smoke sensor, controlling the exhaust flap,
activating the fan, and sounding the alarm.

Exhaust Flap: A physical flap or vent that opens to release smoke from the building's stairwell.

Fan: A fan that helps draw smoke out of the stairwell, facilitating fresh air circulation.

Buzzer: An audible alarm that sounds when smoke is detected, alerting people to the potential danger.
